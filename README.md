# shopping-cart

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

## How to run

Run this command in the repository
```
ember serve
```

## Difficulties 

Since I have no experience with Ember framework, there are some functionalities that I could not get to work properly.

 - The route to the cart is returning ALL items, when it should be returning only the ones that are in the id list.
 - The new total (total after discounts) is not working as well as it should when navigating between the two routes.
 - The new total (total after discounts) is displaying a number with a lot of decimal houses, I couldn't figure out why.
 - Since I spent a lot of time trying to understand the framework, I didn't have time to implement a good UI, so it is been shown as a very simple template page
